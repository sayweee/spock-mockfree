## Spock

Spock is a testing and specification framework for Java and Groovy applications. It combines the main advantages of JUnit, BDD and mocking and is considered a game changer for unit testing. It ensures that all tests written using the framework follow BDD conventions; therefore, the test case is very readable and parameterized.

The only pity is that the latest version of Spock no longer supports PowerMockito. Mocking static classes, private and final fields is cumbersome. For this, we developed this component to enhance its capabilities.
